Try running the idea that 

night 1: u1 r1 z2 visits   (skip any filters not installed)
night 2: g1 i1 y2 visits
night 3:  u5 r20 z30   (I made up those large numbers, but adjust to whatever the deep epochs are)
night 4: g1 i1 y2
night 5: u1 r1 z2
night 6: g10 i20 y30

The AGN metrics are very u/g cadence sensitive. So I think they would say just take the sky brightness hit or maybe switch to 2 g visits in bright time rather than 1.Not sure what the SN would prefer, maybe lowering the visits 10->5 in deep g epochs in bright moon and increasing them 10->15 in dark moon or something like that.
