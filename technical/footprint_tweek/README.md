The area we cover to sufficient depth has dropped quite a bit. fiddle to bring the LMC and bulge back into the same number of visits as WFD

Running with a new footprint that should have the same total number of visits in LMC/SMC, lowdust, and galactic bulge.

Also a version with single-snap visits.
