Cover the NES early with g band.

Going to try by having a survey tier that gathers N g band in year 1,
then the same, but turning down the NES footprint a bit to "pay for it".

nes_early_v4.3.2_10yrs.db:
get NES templates in g 37 days early. Not much impact on the rest of the sky

nes_early_low_v4.3.2_10yrs.db:
Also 37 days faster in g, no major other changes.

Insifnificant impact on the regular science metrics.
